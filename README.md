## Introduction

Image Classification project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to discern and classify images into two emotional categories: sad or happy. Emotion recognition through visual cues is a challenging yet intriguing task with numerous real-world applications, ranging from sentiment analysis in social media to personalized user experiences in human-computer interaction.


## Conv2D

Conv2D layers specialize in detecting patterns and features within images through the application of filters, enabling the network to learn hierarchical representations of the input data. By leveraging this capability, model gains the capacity to extract intricate details and subtle nuances crucial for distinguishing between sad and happy expressions.

Employed appropriate activation functions, such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), to introduce non-linearity and enhance the model's ability to capture complex relationships within the data
